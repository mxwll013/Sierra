From the [official Documentation](https://github.com/mxwll013/Echo/blob/main/docs/index.md):

> The Echo Engine Project is built on three core pillars that guide its architecture and development philosophy: flexibility, maintainability, and scalability. Together, these principles ensure that the engine remains adaptable, cleanly structured, and capable of growing alongside increasingly complex demands. Each pillar reinforces the others, forming a foundation that supports both rapid experimentation and long-term evolution.

This module contains shared tools, conventions, and utilities used across all other modules. It is intended as an internal dependency within the project.
